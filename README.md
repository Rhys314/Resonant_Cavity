# Resonant_Cavity
A python package to visualize resonant cavity modes.

Can be run simply from the main.py script. The first block, which defines N, M and P, allows you to set the number of points along the x, y and z axis, more than twenty can be a little slow.  The next block defines n, m and p, which specifies the mode to be visualised.  The third block is used to define permittivity ε and permeability μ specified by the box material.  The final block you should interact with is the linear frequency f of the mode.
