# Resonant_Cavity
A python package to visualize resonant cavity modes.

Can be run simply from the main.py script. The first block, which defines N, M and P, allows you to set the number of points along the x, y and z axis, more than twenty can be a little slow.  The next block defines n, m and p, which specifies the mode to be visualised.  The third block is used to define permittivity ε and permeability μ specified by the box material.  The final block you should interact with is the linear frequency f of the mode.  The rest of code, that is from line 32 onwards is best avoided until you more confident with python.  All the calculation and plotting paraphernalia is hidden in the modes folder.  If you need TM modes included let me know, I think that should be quick enough for me to sort out on the train.  As we discussed you’ll need to bug Andy if you want me to write something to calculate box dimensions for a given frequency, that would be a bit more complicated.
